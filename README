Aliases
========

Aliases are put in .bash_alias.d/ - one alias per file. 

To create a new alias, there is a function called "create_alias" that will take two or three arguments, the alias name and command and optionally a working path (e.g. if you like to create it somewhere else).

If you want to migrate your aliases to the system used in this repository, there's a tool for that - the function convert_rc_alias


Looper
========

The looper script in the bin directory is neat, if you need to call the same
bash function over and over again, just with different parameters.
I made it for nslookups but the script should work just fine with every 
other function as well.


Misc
========

Some of the aliases, paths and functions are Ubuntu/Debian specific, like 
aliases that just put a sudo in front of the function call. You might not
need those or those might even break something.


As always - use things with caution and look into what you are doing BEFORE 
actually doing it! :)
